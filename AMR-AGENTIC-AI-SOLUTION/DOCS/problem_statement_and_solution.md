Industries such as manufacturing, logistics, retail, and warehousing increasingly rely on Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) for material movement and shop-floor operations. As adoption scales, managing heterogeneous fleets in dynamic environments has become a major challenge.
Current fleet management systems offer dashboards, task creation interfaces, and real-time monitoring, but orchestration still depends heavily on manual intervention for creating tasks, assigning robots, monitoring progress, detecting conflicts, and replanning routes under changing conditions. This manual approach is reactive, inefficient, and prone to errors—especially when handling large fleets and simultaneous tasks.
Organizations lack an AI-driven orchestration layer that can autonomously interpret tasks from multiple sources, assign them to the most suitable robot based on context (location, battery, payload, SLAs), coordinate multi-robot workflows, anticipate congestion, and replan under unexpected conditions like blocked paths or rush orders.
The absence of such intelligence leads to operational inefficiency (idle robots, delayed tasks), suboptimal decisions at scale, and cognitive overload for human operators. Manual orchestration cannot sustain real-time accuracy as operations grow.
To address these gaps, enterprises need Agentic AI agents within fleet management systems—capable of proactive reasoning, adaptive decision-making, and autonomous coordination—ensuring efficiency, safety, and scalability.

Organizations operating autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) face growing complexity in task orchestration as operations scale. Manual coordination of tasks—such as assigning robots, monitoring progress, and handling disruptions—cannot sustain real-time accuracy, leading to idle assets, delayed orders, and cognitive overload for human operators. To address this, we propose an AI-driven orchestration layer powered by IBM watsonx Agents and watsonx Assistant. This solution enables seamless task creation, execution, and status monitoring with proactive alerts.
Incoming requests from multiple sources—WMS, ERP, operator commands—are interpreted by a Coordinator Agent, which normalizes task details and applies business rules. Assignment and Path Planner Agents then select the most suitable AMR based on real-time context such as location, battery level, payload capacity, and SLA priorities, while optimizing routes to avoid congestion. Execution is fully integrated with AMR APIs, ensuring closed-loop control and dynamic replanning when unexpected conditions arise.
Supervisors gain a conversational interface via watsonx Assistant to create tasks, query AMR status, and approve critical actions, reducing cognitive load and improving transparency. Predictive alerts for SLA risks, battery thresholds, and blocked paths enable proactive intervention or automated corrections under governance controls. All decisions are logged with reason codes for audit and compliance, supported by watsonx.data and watsonx.governance.
This intelligent orchestration layer transforms fragmented, manual workflows into a scalable, autonomous system that improves operational efficiency, maximizes robot utilization, and ensures timely fulfillment—delivering measurable ROI and resilience for high-volume, dynamic environments.
